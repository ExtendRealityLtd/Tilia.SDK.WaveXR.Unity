## 1.0.0 (2023-03-22)

#### Features

* **structure:** add initial implementation of Wave SDK wrapper ([25641f9](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.SDK.WaveXR.Unity/commit/25641f995c0a705b29573951338e7c41421a0e22))
  > The WaveXR SDK wrapper provides a way of being able to use the WaveXR SDK for Unity directly with the TrackedAlias so the underlying WaveXR SDK can be leveraged whilst still keeping a level of generics to the project.
